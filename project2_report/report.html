        Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization?

      <h2>Proposition: There is increased distrust in the NYPD over time by people of color. </h2>

      <section>
        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../_images/for.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Difference in count between non-POC and POC complaints over time, showing a marked increase in complaints by people of color from 2000 to 2016</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Usage of color gradient to emphasize differences in complaint rates over time.</li>
          <li>Inclusion of a zero-line to emphasize the inherent gap always present between complaints from non-POC and minorities.</li>
          <li>Aggregation using difference in count between non-POC and POC complaints.</li>
          <li>Scale: 1, This visualization while earnest in intent and mathematic portrayal, the usage of the difference may be slightly deceptive.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../_images/against.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Count of complaints by white and non-white ethnicity groups over time, showing a similar shape in trend from 2000 to 2015.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Intentional usage of similar color palette to create a sense of cohesion between the two groups and bring confusion to the audience.</li>
          <li>Manipulation of axis scales to obscure the true extent of the disparity.</li>
          <li>As direct result of two points above, using the same color for the misleading axis as its line such that it is harder to spot the label</li>
          <li>Scale: -2, this visualization is meant to confuse at a glance such that those looking at only the line shape and the title to discern a conclusion.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>The common theme for this project across both visualizations includes the importance of context and the importance to do due diligence in investigating
          to understand the full story behind data (and how it's represented). My key design choice for the "for" proposition visualization was to emphasize the 
          gradient as a sense of urgency. The key design choice for the "against" proposition was to manipulate the axes. 
          <br>
          <br>
          For the deceptive visualization against the proposition, 
          it was difficult to add deceptive elements without using erratic calculations on the dataset. As such, for both, grouping and filtering the ethnicities
          allowed for better understanding of the trends at hand. It was easier for the persuasive visualization to use the data at hand without heavy calculation or axes manipulation; keeping that portion simple.
          <br>
          <br>
          What ended up being interesting and to my prior point is how both visualizations, 
          whether or not the argument is ethical/supported properly, there can still be deceptive elements- just a difference in "direction" of persuasion. Citing some of the lecture remarks by Sam, often
          times the best visualizations and typically by effect more ethical ones are the ones that are simplest, clear, and direct (in regards to data-ink ratio).
          <br>
          <br>
          In doing this exercise, I can consequently identify "acceptable" persuasive choices as ones that enhance the clarity of the message
          without distorting the data, but perhaps more importantly ones that are not just naked data but include context whether through 
          clear paragraph annotation or simplicity in design. The "misleading" or deceptive choices are ones that perform manipulations through calculations
          or axes manipulations to exagerrate differences. Additionally these deceptive or poor visualizations often will lack information, cherry pick data, 
          or leave out plot elements.
